{{!-- this is a partial template that can be included in other handlebars templates; this one in particular allows other templates to include comments without having to put this chunk of code into every page we want to display comments --}}

<div class="comments">
  {{!-- #each allows us to iterate over a list, and using 'this' allows us to reference the element we are iterating over, which in our case is comments --}}
  {{#each this}}
  <section class="comment">
    <div class="meta">
      {{!-- the double curly braces surround handlebars expressions, in this case the output will be the user's username and the date the comment was made; format_date is a helper included in utils/helper.js that formats the date --}}
      {{user.username}} on {{format_date created_at}}
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      {{comment_text}}
